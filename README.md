# ECS 32B Grading

### Requirements
You will have to download each student assignment into the directory containing `grader.py` and it's dependencies.
Then, simply run `python grader.py`.

In order for this to work, the student assignments must be named `hw1.py`, `hw3.py`, etc... 

### Usage

Please remember that these are not the final test to see how well a student did on the assignment. It's more like a tool that will help you decide how carefully you need to look at the student's code. If everything passes, you won't have to look so hard.
 
 `[PASSED]` means the code works as expected; just glance at their implementation to make sure it looks good.
 
 `[ERROR]` means there are some problems with the code. The issues should be listed directly above the tag.
 
  
 Hopefully this is more of a help than a hindrance! Good luck.
