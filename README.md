# hw2grading

You will have to download each student assignment into the directory containing `grader.py` and `nodes.py`.
Then, simply run `python grader.py`. You'll have to grade the slice method by hand.

In order for this to work, the student assignments must be named `hw2.py`. 

Please remember that this is not the final test to see how well a student did on the assignment. It's more like a tool that will help you decide how carefully you need to look at the student's code. If everything passes, you won't have to look so hard.
 
 `[PASSED]` tags means it works as expected; just check that their implementation is good.
 
 `[ERROR]` tags means there are some problems with the class. The methods that caused issues should be listed directly above the tag.
 
 `_____crashed!` tags mean some sort of exception occurred. Check the formatting of their assignment, method names, etc...
